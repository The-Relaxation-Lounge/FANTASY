FANTASY Made to Bend all Levels of Reality

Believe it or not, I used real flashes of lightning to create this very timed YouTube music video. I had also used this real light show in my Mi7 video with all them high tech looking flashes and flickers. Real Flash Lightning is also used here, which took me almost two months to tweak and make sure the flashes looked as if they are actually doing the beat to the YouTube music. Again, I had to use a crappy, slow laptop to create this poor quality video, but no fret, you can use a cellphone or a Sony PSP, which have small screen sizes for better quality. I hope you 'can' enjoy this short music video.

Aquastellar One By Joseph C. Richardson

Welcome aboard my Aquastellar One Submarine and swim much, much faster than the slow speed of light alright! Buckle up tight Cowboy, we are going to Warp 'ONE' or should I just say, Warp 'Infinity'?

Note: the voice over had to be redone, so it's lip talking. My friend didn't record me at all, and thought he had. My mouth isn't exactly what I had originally said before. But the video is much better on smaller screens, due to using a slow laptop and couldn't muster up the kind of vivid quality, I much needed. but if you watch this on a smaller screen, like a cellphone or a Sony PSP, you will see a much cleaner and clear video output. I hope you enjoy swimming at the incomprehensible speeds we will be experiencing. So hold on tight and enjoy the ride of your life.

My AQUASTELLAR ONE FISH AQUARIUM By Joseph C. Richardson

Watch until the very end of this video and see how an electric cyan UFO takes my aquarium away, within a mere flash, right before your very eyes.

The only thing that's even real in this video are the Angelfish and the screen window, which shows the actual tank. The fish tank in this video is actually 100% TurboCad drawing, right to the exact tank's measurements, which make this special effect look as if it's a real fish tank. The scene is also 100% fake. The background was dedicated to me from an online poet, who really loved my writings and my short science fiction story. Angels In The Sun; I still never finished it all the way. All I have left is the final plot twist, when the Interstellar One goes far beyond the speed of light and into the stark evolution of Humans who are nothing more than Pure Energy on Pure Thought alone, from the year Nine Sextillion, which is 9 and 21 0's, like this huge number.
9,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. These humans are both male and female. No such things as being gay or this or that. Humans have long surpassed the need for wanting material things or any such prejudice thoughts at all. They simply Self Reproduce, much like snails can.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the candles on the pedestals are real, but the pedestals themselves are fake; everything is fake, but the fish tank window and candles; they are real. I just used cleaver math and special effects to make the viewer believe that it's all real. You could say I have a touch of Disney in me. I just wished I could have been one of Disney's Imagineers is all. lol

AQUASTELLAR ONE By Joseph C  Richardson

This (once) was my awesome aquarium I used to own. I loved it, but the tank was so customized that I couldn't replace any type of filter at all. The only way to save my fish from dying, I had to give them back to the pet store freely just so they wouldn't die on me. I have a really soft spot for animals and kids alike. But here is another video you might have to watch on a smaller screen, such as a cellphone or a Sony PSP. The laptop I had just couldn't muster up the rendering speeds I needed for best 1080p quality. Nonetheless, I can only hope you enjoy this awesome, well lit up aquarium. I wanted to create a hundred gallon Led Aquarium with nothing but my favorite fish, which are Angelfish. I just love them so much.

KNOWLEDGE POEM PONDER INTO WONDER! By Joseph C. Richardson

‘Knowledge’
is a free invention of the heart and of the mind itself!
The only textbooks needed, are the heart and the mind.
The only exam to be written is the key to ponder into wonder.
For the heart and the mind hold the key to the greatest diploma of all,
the dream’s creation of our imagination.
For the heart and the mind are thus, the greatest teachers of us…
Believe in yourself! For you are their greatest student.

THIS BELONGS TO EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD
Never give up your dream, no matter how far away it may seem to be, because that is when it is ever so close to becoming true. If you dream of something long enough and strong enough, your dream will come true, when you least expect it. Always remember, we are never too young or too old to dream and use our imagination, for we only get one and it is ours forever. May your heart be filled with courage and compassion, and your mind be as limitless and as wondrous as the universe itself!
If you dream it, you can be it. Believe it!

Hello my friend. Please think of this Knowledge poem as if it were a portal into our dream’s creation come true. Please read it twice! And always remember: What's behind the light beholds the answer to all things possible! Everyone has dreams, but it's most important to keep them, even if they take an entire lifetime to come true...

 Hello my friend. Please read this Knowledge poem and read it twice! I wrote these precious words through my very own tears of failure, when I thought I had lost my second chance at achieving my adult high school diploma, and in the same year 1997, I also broke two computers back to back; my own, trying to repair them. After writing this Knowledge poem, I achieved far more than I can ever be thankful enough for. I achieved my high school diploma in early 2001, and I never broke another computer ever again; I went pretty far with them as well. Since then, I wanted every single man, woman and child to have this Knowledge poem forever for free to unleash the tapestry of pure imagination, and to make everyone's dreams come true for them too! Please encourage others abound, even if you don’t know them or like them. Sometimes, we all need help to believe in ourselves again, especially when our dreams feel so broken that sometimes, it’s simply hard to believe in ourselves. This is my personal gift to all humanity, which was also my very own personal portal into my very own personal dream’s creation come true. Whoever shall read this Knowledge poem has already opened up a portal into their personal dream’s creation come truth...

Just one very important lesson to always remember: learn how to play again; that’s the key to ponder into wonder. That’s the key which makes all dreams possible! And that’s the only exam to be written…

The human imagination should never ever be bought or sold; by doing such, it will only dry up one day. Some things are supposed to be free. Some things are just too priceless to buy. Some things are just too precious to sell. Some things just have to be free to all humanity period! Since the inception of this Knowledge poem, I made it a humanitarian right to have these priceless, precious words forever, for free. 

This Knowledge poem will never ever be bought or sold to anyone, which means it could also remain unpublished forever. May your heart be filled with courage and compassion, and your mind be as limitless and as wondrous as the universe itself! If you dream it, you can be it. Believe it!

Your imagination can take you far. It just depends on how much you let it expand...

ALIENS AMONG US ALIENS ABOVE US By Joseph C. Richardson

For those who don't believe that aliens are real, you'd better think again. All you need to do is gaze in a mirror at your very own reflection and you will see a real alien appear right before your very eyes.
