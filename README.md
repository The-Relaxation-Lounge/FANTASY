FANTASY Made to Bend all Levels of Reality

Believe it or not, I used real flashes of lightning to create this very timed YouTube music video. I had also used this real light show in my Mi7 video with all them high tech looking flashes and flickers. Real Flash Lightning is also used here, which took me almost two months to tweak and make sure the flashes looked as if they are actually doing the beat to the YouTube music. Again, I had to use a crappy, slow laptop to create this poor quality video, but no fret, you can use a cellphone or a Sony PSP, which have small screen sizes for better quality. I hope you 'can' enjoy this short music video.

Aquastellar One By Joseph C. Richardson

Welcome aboard my Aquastellar One Submarine and swim much, much faster than the slow speed of light alright! Buckle up tight Cowboy, we are going to Warp 'ONE' or should I just say, Warp 'Infinity'?

Note: the voice over had to be redone, so it's lip talking. My friend didn't record me at all, and thought he had. My mouth isn't exactly what I had originally said before. But the video is much better on smaller screens, due to using a slow laptop and couldn't muster up the kind of vivid quality, I much needed. but if you watch this on a smaller screen, like a cellphone or a Sony PSP, you will see a much cleaner and clear video output. I hope you enjoy swimming at the incomprehensible speeds we will be experiencing. So hold on tight and enjoy the ride of your life.

My AQUASTELLAR ONE FISH AQUARIUM By Joseph C. Richardson

Watch until the very end of this video and see how an electric cyan UFO takes my aquarium away, within a mere flash, right before your very eyes.

The only thing that's even real in this video are the Angelfish and the screen window, which shows the actual tank. The fish tank in this video is actually 100% TurboCad drawing, right to the exact tank's measurements, which make this special effect look as if it's a real fish tank. The scene is also 100% fake. The background was dedicated to me from an online poet, who really loved my writings and my short science fiction story. Angels In The Sun; I still never finished it all the way. All I have left is the final plot twist, when the Interstellar One goes far beyond the speed of light and into the stark evolution of Humans who are nothing more than Pure Energy on Pure Thought alone, from the year Nine Sextillion, which is 9 and 21 0's, like this huge number.
9,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. These humans are both male and female. No such things as being gay or this or that. Humans have long surpassed the need for wanting material things or any such prejudice thoughts at all. They simply Self Reproduce, much like snails can.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the candles on the pedestals are real, but the pedestals themselves are fake; everything is fake, but the fish tank window and candles; they are real. I just used cleaver math and special effects to make the viewer believe that it's all real. You could say I have a touch of Disney in me. I just wished I could have been one of Disney's Imagineers is all. lol
