FANTASY Made to Bend all Levels of Reality

Believe it or not, I used real flashes of lightning to create this very timed YouTube music video. I had also used this real light show in my Mi7 video with all them high tech looking flashes and flickers. Real Flash Lightning is also used here, which took me almost two months to tweak and make sure the flashes looked as if they are actually doing the beat to the YouTube music. Again, I had to use a crappy, slow laptop to create this poor quality video, but no fret, you can use a cellphone or a Sony PSP, which have small screen sizes for better quality. I hope you 'can' enjoy this short music video.
