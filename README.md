FANTASY Made to Bend all Levels of Reality

Believe it or not, I used real flashes of lightning to create this very timed YouTube music video. I had also used this real light show in my Mi7 video with all them high tech looking flashes and flickers. Real Flash Lightning is also used here, which took me almost two months to tweak and make sure the flashes looked as if they are actually doing the beat to the YouTube music. Again, I had to use a crappy, slow laptop to create this poor quality video, but no fret, you can use a cellphone or a Sony PSP, which have small screen sizes for better quality. I hope you 'can' enjoy this short music video.

Aquastellar One By Joseph C. Richardson

Welcome aboard my Aquastellar One Submarine and swim much, much faster than the slow speed of light alright! Buckle up tight Cowboy, we are going to Warp 'ONE' or should I just say, Warp 'Infinity'?

Note: the voice over had to be redone, so it's lip talking. My friend didn't record me at all, and thought he had. My mouth isn't exactly what I had originally said before. But the video is much better on smaller screens, due to using a slow laptop and couldn't muster up the kind of vivid quality, I much needed. but if you watch this on a smaller screen, like a cellphone or a Sony PSP, you will see a much cleaner and clear video output. I hope you enjoy swimming at the incomprehensible speeds we will be experiencing. So hold on tight and enjoy the ride of your life.
